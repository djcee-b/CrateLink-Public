          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 text-blue-400">Why I Built CrateLink</h3>
          <blockquote class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-6 italic">
            "I wanted to get to know my library inside out. But I didn't have time."
          </blockquote>
          <div class="text-gray-400 space-y-4">
            <p>
              As a DJ, I've always loved the process of knowing my Music Library inside out, finding hidden gems, and thinking of new transitions. But with work, the gym, family, and just life in general — sitting at my laptop for hours to listen through tracks felt impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'd download new edits, build crates, and promise myself I'd go back and listen properly later. But later never came.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I built CrateLink.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted a way to stay connected to my music without needing to be at my laptop. Now I can listen in the car. At the gym. On walks. Whenever life gives me a window.
            </p>
            <p>
              CrateLink helps me actually get to know my library again — and because of that, my sets are tighter, my transitions are cleaner, and I'm finally using the music I download instead of just collecting it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-400">
              This isn't just an app. It's a way for busy DJs like me to stay in tune with their music — anywhere, anytime.

            <p class="text-gray-400">
              If you choose to go Pro, your payment of $20 gets you the app download and lifetime access to the community plus a 1:1 onboarding session with a trainer. You may have the opportunity to upgrade as we release new versions of the app, but you don't have to pay anything more if you don't want to.

              Do you love to ride your bike? Then it's for you. We've seen members start off riding as little as 5 miles per week and work their way up to 50-mile day trips within a few months.

              It's totally up to you. We think you'll have more fun if you complete your profile and contribute to the forums, but you can also use the platform as a more straightforward fitness app if you'd like.

            <p class="text-gray-400">
              Right away! As of May 2017, the app is out of beta and our community is growing by dozens of members each week. In fact, we'd recommend joining as soon as possible—we won't be able to maintain the low introductory price forever.

            <p class="text-gray-400">
              You'll start by choosing the kinds of rides you like to do (road, gravel, or mountain). Then, we'll show you individual and group challenges based on your preferences. You can always adjust your profile settings later.

              Anyone can use the app and join the community. That said, the Find My Ride feature is currently available only for Canada and the U.S. We hope to expand to other countries soon.
